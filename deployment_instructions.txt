# Deployment Instructions for Render

This guide explains how to deploy the video downloader bot to Render.

## Prerequisites

*   A Render account. You can sign up at [https://render.com/](https://render.com/).
*   A GitHub repository containing your bot's code (main.py, requirements.txt).

## Steps

1.  **Create a new web service on Render:**
    *   Log in to your Render account.
    *   Click on "New +" and select "Web Service".
    *   Connect your GitHub repository.

2.  **Configure the web service:**
    *   **Name:** Choose a name for your service.
    *   **Environment:** Select "Python 3".
    *   **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **Start Command:** `python main.py`
    *   In the "Run command" field, enter `python main.py`.
    *   **Region:** Choose a region close to your users.

3.  **Set environment variables:**
    *   Go to the "Environment" section for your service.
    *   Add a new environment variable:
        *   **Key:** `BOT_TOKEN`
        *   **Value:** Your actual Telegram Bot Token.
    *   Add any other required environment variables here.

4.  **Deploy the service:**
    *   Click on "Create Web Service".
    *   Render will automatically build and deploy your bot.

## Telegram Bot Usage

1.  Send the /start command to the bot to initiate the conversation.
2.  Send a YouTube link to the bot.
3.  The bot will reply with options to download the video or audio.
4.  The bot will automatically detect URLs. If it's a YouTube link, it will ask you to choose between video and audio format using buttons. For other links, it will start downloading the video directly.

## Notes

*   Render automatically detects changes in your GitHub repository and redeploys your bot.
*   You can view the logs in the Render dashboard to troubleshoot any issues.
*   Make sure your bot token is stored securely. Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding it in the code.
