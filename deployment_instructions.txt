    *   Render will automatically build and deploy your bot.

## Telegram Bot Usage

1.  Send the /start command to the bot to initiate the conversation.

## Notes

*   Render automatically detects changes in your GitHub repository and redeploys your bot.

*   Make sure your bot token is stored securely. Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding it in the code.
